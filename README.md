👋 Hi, I’m @richardye101
🌱 I’m currently studying statistics and finance at the University of Toronto, but I'm looking to do a Masters in CS next year. I have a ton of experience working in **R**, **python**, **SQL**, and **java** and I'm currently interested in learning C++ and System Design. I'm also generally inerested in becoming a better software developer, so I can better apply my ML knowledge.
📕 I've done three research projects, which you can find at
  - 🐀[Improving sensitivity and specificity of african rats in detecting teburculosis](https://github.com/richardye101/ohrats)
  - 🧑‍🎓[Analyzing the connection between langauges, STEM attitudes and usage of online learning of Canadian Elementary School Students](https://github.com/richardye101/OISE-Online-Learning-and-STEM-Research)
  - 💱[Exploring the applications of NLP techniques in classifying, clustering, and forecasting public companies based on their 10K filings](https://github.com/richardye101/ubineer_nlp_research)
